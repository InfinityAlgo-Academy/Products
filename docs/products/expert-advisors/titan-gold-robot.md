## 🏦 algorithmic Philosophy: XAUUSD Specialization
Gold (XAUUSD) is not just another currency pair; it is a safe-haven asset with unique volatility characteristics. **Titan Gold Robot** is engineered specifically to exploit the "micro-fractures" in Gold's price during the London and New York overlaps.

Unlike general forex EAs that fail on Gold due to its high spread and sudden spikes, this algorithm utilizes a **Dynamic Volatility Filter**. It measures the Average True Range (ATR) in real-time and adjusts its entry logic. If the market is too calm, it waits. If it's too chaotic (News Events), it engages its "Protection Mode".

## ⚙️ Technical Mechanics & Logic
At its core, the system operates on a **Mean Reversion** combined with **Momentum Breakout** logic:
1.  **Liquidity Sweep Detection:** The bot identifies key support/resistance levels where retail stops are clustered.
2.  **Entry Validation:** It waits for a "Fake-out" to occur, trapping retail traders, then enters in the direction of the institutional move.
3.  **Smart Grid System:** If the price moves against the initial entry, a carefully calculated recovery grid (non-martingale options available) is deployed to neutralize the drawdown.

### Core Features:
*   **News Filter:** Links to ForexFactory calendar to pause trading during High Impact USD news.
*   **Trailing Stop:** An intelligent equity trailer that locks in profit tick-by-tick.
*   **DD Control:** Hard Equity Stop Loss separates this from dangerous "blow-up" bots.

## 📊 Backtesting & Robustness
We have stress-tested **Titan Gold Robot** on 99.9% quality tick data from 2015 to 2024 using Tick Data Suite (TDS).
*   **Slippage Simulation:** Tested with variable spreads (20-40 points) and execution delays (100-200ms).
*   **Monte Carlo Analysis:** Passed 1000 simulations with randomized parameters to ensure the edge is not "curve-fitted".
