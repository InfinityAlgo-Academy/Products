## 🧠 Advanced Algorithmic Logic
**Risk Reward Calculator** represents the next generation of automated trading. By moving away from lagging indicators like MACD or RSI, we focus on **Price Action & Order Flow**. The algorithm monitors the market structure in real-time, identifying institutional footprints.

## 🛡️ Risk Management Protocols
Capital preservation is the cornerstone of this system.
*   **Dynamic Position Sizing:** Lot size calculates automatically based on your account balance and risk tolerance (%).
*   **Stealth Mode:** Profit and Stop Loss levels are hidden from the broker to prevent "Stop Hunting".
*   **Equity Guard:** A fail-safe mechanism that closes all trades if global equity drops by a defined percentage.

## 📈 Performance Verification
Designed for long-term consistency. The strategy aims for a Sharpe Ratio > 1.5, meaning the returns justify the risk taken.
